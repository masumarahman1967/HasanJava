    Class-- Class is collection of attribute and behaviour
    Class has logical entity
    Class is blueprint of object
    Will not occupied any memory
    Class contains variable and method
    ---------------------------
    Object --- Object is an instance of a class
    Physical entity
    Needs space in memory
    We can create any number of object
    Objects are independent

    /*
    constructor--
    constructor name must be class name
    No return type(never return anything) ,even no void key word,no access modifier
    we can just assign variable
    we can not use any conditional statement,no looping statement,no if else condition, nothing......
    constructor should be very simple
    constructor can not be static,final,abstract,synchronized
    constructor cannot br override
    when we call constructor parent constructor call first.Also we can use supper() keyword to call constructor.
    *******
    we used constructor-

     to create object
     for initialized object
    to assign value to the variables while creating object

    Main advantage of constructor is
    The constructor overloading enables the accomplishment of ststic polymorphism.
